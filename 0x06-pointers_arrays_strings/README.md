## Files & Descriptions

[0-strcat.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/0-strcat.c)  a function that concatenates two strings</br>
[1-strncat.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/1-strncat.c)  a function that concatenates two strings</br>
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that

   - it will use at most n bytes from src; and
   - src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes

[2-strncpy.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strncpy.c)  a function that copies a string</br>
[3-strcmp.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strcmp.c)  a function that compares two strings</br>
[4-rev_array.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/4-rev_array.c)  a function that reverses the content of an array of integers</br>
[5-string_toupper.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/5-string_toupper.c)  a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase</br>
[6-cap_string.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/6-cap_string.c)  a function that capitalizes all words of a string</br>
[7-leet.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/7-leet.c)  a function that encodes a string into 1337.

   - Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
   - Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
   - Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
   - Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
   - Letters l and L should be replaced by 1</br>

[8-rot13.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/8-rot13.c)  a function that encodes a string using rot13</br>
[100-print_number.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/100-print_number.c)  a function that prints an integer</br>
[101-magic.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/101-magic.c)  Adding one line to (this code)[https://github.com/holbertonschool/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c], so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.</br>

Here is a list of what i'm allowed and not allowed to use:
   - You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
   - You are not allowed to modify the variable p
   - You can only write one statement
   - You are not allowed to use ,
   - You are not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
   - Your code should be written at line 19, before the ;
   - Do not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments)
   - and don’t change anything but the line of code you are adding (don’t change the spaces to tabs!)
   - You are allowed to use the standard library

[102-infinite_add.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/102-infinitie_add.c)  a function that adds two numbers</br>
[103-print_buffer.c](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/103-print_buffer.c)  a function that prints a buffer</br>
